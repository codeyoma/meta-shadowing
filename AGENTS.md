## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in `codeyoma/meta-shadowing` GitHub Issues using the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the canonical labels `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, and `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context repo using root `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Git and releases

Before starting a branch, publishing commits or issue/PR content, merging a PR, or changing deployment settings, read `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`, including its public repository privacy rules. Feature PRs target `dev`; only user-approved release PRs from `dev` target `main`.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
